# Java Level 2 Projects ⚔️

Welcome! This repository contains six intermediate-level Java projects I built to go deeper into **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. These projects explore concepts like **classes and objects**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **interfaces**, **method overloading**, and **interactions between multiple classes**.

Each project is in its own folder with source code, clear structure, and a console interface for user interaction. Feel free to explore and build on them!

## 📚 Projects Overview

### ✅ 1. Library Manager (Console)

**Goals:**

* Use classes, objects, and encapsulated data
* Handle book creation, status, and search

**What it does:**

* Lets the user add, search, display, borrow, and return books using a simple menu.

📌 **Concepts Used:** `ArrayList`, `class`, `methods`, `Scanner`, `encapsulation`, `toString()`

📂 Folder: `/library-manager`

### ✅ 2. Student Grades System

**Goals:**

* Handle lists of students with multiple notes
* Calculate individual averages

**What it does:**

* Lets the user create students, assign grades, and view averages or full student lists.

📌 **Concepts Used:** `class`, `ArrayList`, `double`, `Scanner`, `getters/setters`

📂 Folder: `/student-grades`

### ✅ 3. Bank Account Simulator

**Goals:**

* Simulate real-world banking operations with account management

**What it does:**

* Allows user to create accounts, check balances, deposit or withdraw money.

📌 **Concepts Used:** `encapsulation`, `methods`, `Scanner`, `if/else`, `this`, multiple objects

📂 Folder: `/bank-simulator`

### ✅ 4. Virtual Zoo

**Goals:**

* Practice inheritance and polymorphism

**What it does:**

* Each animal has its own sound/behavior. User can view or add animals and hear them "talk".

📌 **Concepts Used:** `inheritance`, `polymorphism`, `method override`, `ArrayList`, `super`

📂 Folder: `/virtual-zoo`

### ✅ 5. Travel Booking System

**Goals:**

* Model relationships between classes (Client, Voyage, Reservation)

**What it does:**

* Lets user create clients, reserve or cancel trips, and view their reservations.

📌 **Concepts Used:** `class interaction`, `List`, `Scanner`, `relations between objects`, `encapsulation`

📂 Folder: `/travel-booking`

---

### ✅ 6. Combat Game (Turn-Based)

**Goals:**

* Build a dynamic game with turns, attack logic, and healing options

**What it does:**

* Two players (Mage, Warrior, Archer...) fight in turns.
* Each can attack or skip a turn to regain **random health (5-15 HP)**. Game ends when one loses all HP.

📌 **Concepts Used:** `abstract class`, `interface`, `inheritance`, `Math.random()`, `Scanner`, game loop

📂 Folder: `/combat-game`

1. Open your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code...).
2. Choose a project folder.
3. Run the `Main.java` file or main class inside `/src`.
4. Interact via the terminal menu.
